          <p>
            This game was created during my last semester at Harvey Mudd
            College. I was taking a class called Object-Oriented Game
            Development and this was my group's final project. I'm gonna be
            honest here and say that this was not an easy project. Although my
            group and I had worked diligently up until the last week before the
            project was due, something that I didn't anticipate came to my
            attention; our code was incompatible. We had three students working
            on the code portion of the task including myself; our last group
            member created the pixel art. In an attempt to save our grades I
            decided to stray from the original concept of the game. The
            Claremont Trials was originally supposed to be conceptually similar
            to Super Mario Brothers; a side-scrolling level based game. As we no
            longer had the time to create multiple levels I salvaged whatever I
            could from the current repository and decided to make a mini-game.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective of the game is simple: complete as many homework
            assignments as you can until time runs out. The more assignments you
            complete, the higher your score. Implementing this 'simple' game
            however, was harder than it sounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to make a menu for the user, and then I had to link that menu
            to two different options, "Play Game" or "Exit". Then in order to
            make the game a bit more fun I imported some funky music that at
            first played only in the menu but not when the player navigated to
            the game screen. Then I had to make homework assignments fall from
            the sky at seemingly 'random' positions along the width of the
            screen. Then I had to shoot pencils out of my character object. Then
            I had to keep track of scoring every time a homework assignment
            collided with a pencil but as a side effect my character would
            disappear!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also tedious as I was using C++, meaning I had to think about
            memory allocation; when it was appropriate to deallocate memory. I
            also had to learn how to keep track of the game score using an XML
            file.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of the times, I felt like I was banging my head into a wall. I
            kept stumbling across bug after bug, even though I was implementing
            one feature at a time. But you know what? It was worth it in the
            end. It turned out pretty decent, so here's a demo!

            If you want to try out the game yourself, just navigate to
            TheClaremontTrials repo on my GitHub, and follow the Read Me
            document. You can access my GitHub profile by clicking on the icon
            in the footer. Oh and, a score of 400 means you got a 4.00 GPA.
            Happy studying!
