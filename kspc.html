								<h2>"It is your job to narrow down what the customer wants"</h2>
								<p>At Harvey Mudd College, every Computer Science major takes a course titled Software Development, otherwise known as CS121. The objective of the course is to get students used to real world software development. For a majority of this course we were split into groups, and each group was assigned to a local organization or person within our communnity. One of the groups created a Shakespeare play reader. Another group created a food recipe mobile application. We, along with another group, worked for KSPC, a college radio station in Claremont, CA. More specifically, my group was tasked with the creation of a new website.</p>
								<p>As project manager for the first half of the project I became the liasion between KSPC and my group. I communicated any questions my group and I had for our client by email. I was also communicating our progress to the other group under KSPC, whose product would later be displayed on our website. Every week we would meet with a representative from KSPC. We would discuss what they wanted, our current progress, and our goal for the upcoming week. During the entire project, we followed agile software development practices.</p>
								<p>We realized what the client wanted late into the project; an aesthetically pleasing website that contained all of the customizations available through WordPress. The irony here is that WordPress websites can look just as aesthetically pleasing as any other website; the client just didn't know how to use the software. In hindsight, I've realized that sometimes the developers or engineers need to be the ones offering a solution. Sometimes, the client doesn't know what they want until they see it. As such, it is our job to provide as many viable solutions as we can brainstorm to the client, who then decides the best course of action.</p>
								<p>Sad to say our website didn't end up as beautiful as we envisioned it. However, we were able to mimic a majority of the functionality that WordPress provided. At the end of our project, the client could create and edit posts. In order to save old posts, we migrated their data to a relational database. In the end however, it just didn't look quite right.</p>
								<p>If you want to take a look, the website project is in a repository on my GitHub (you can access my GitHub profile by clicking the Git icon in the footer). Just squint a little while you're looking at it.</p>
