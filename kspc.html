          <p>
            At Harvey Mudd College every Computer Science major takes a course
            called Software Development, otherwise known as CS121. The objective
            of the course is to get students acquainted with real world software
            development. For a majority of the course we were split into groups
            of four and each group was assigned to a local organization or
            person within our community. My group, along with one other group,
            worked for KSPC, a college radio station in Claremont, CA. Our task
            was to create a new website for KSPC.
          </p>
          <p>
            As project manager for the first half of the project I became the
            liasion between KSPC and my group. I communicated any questions my
            group and I had by email. I was also communicating our progress to
            the other group working for KSPC, whose product, a historic
            timeline, would be displayed on our website. Every week we would
            meet with a representative from KSPC. We would discuss what they
            wanted, our current progress and our goal for the upcoming week.
            During the project we worked in an agile environment.

            We didn't realize what our client wanted until we were deep into the
            project; an aesthetically pleasing website that contained all of the
            customizations available through WordPress. The irony here is that
            we could've used WordPress, we didn't have to create a website from
            scratch. In hindsight, I realized it was our task to provide as many
            viable solutions as we could brainstorm to the client. Doing so
            would've saved us a lot of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, our website didn't end up as beautiful as we envisioned it.
            However, we were able to mimic a sample of the functionality that
            WordPress provides. We migrated KSPC's data to a relational database
            to display the old website's posts. Using our website KSPC was able
            to create new posts and edit old ones in a more intuitive manner
            than their previous process.

            repository on my GitHub (click the GitHub icon in the footer).
