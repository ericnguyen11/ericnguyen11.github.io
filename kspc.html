								<h2>"We are what we repeatedly do"</h2>
								<p>When I was a senior in high school I started to think about success. What does it mean to be succesful? How does someone succeed in something? How do I become successful at what I want to do? These are some of the questions that occupied my mind from time to time, and for a while I left them on the surface; I didn't really want to commit my time to answering those questions.</p>
								<p>It wasn't until recently when a close relative of mine was diagnosed with cancer that I decided to revisit those questions. With the diagnosis, I began to realize that for all of us, time isn't a guarantee; any day could be our last. I told myself that I couldn't take my time for granted anymore, and that I needed to live my best possible life right now.</p>
								<p>I started to write in my journal. I wrote down all of my dreams and the steps I needed to take in order to manifest those dreams. I took those steps and made them into habits; actions that I've decided to commit to for years. And, maybe someday, with all the habits I've established and continue to work on, I'll get there. If I keep at it, maybe someday these dreams will become my reality. Maybe someday, I'll become a self-made man, someone people can look up to and gain inspiration from. I'll automate the things people don't want to do, small and large tasks. And someday, maybe I'll shape the world of virtual reality, blurring the lines between reality and code.</p>
								<p>I'm giving it my best shot, one day, one step at a time.</p>
