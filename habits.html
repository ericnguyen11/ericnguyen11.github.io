          <h2>"I really wish I had a simple application to track my habits"</h2>
          <p>
            That quote is pretty much the entire reason why I created this
            application. I wanted to work on myself by committing to some
            habits, but as there were a lot of habits to track I needed
            something to remind me. I was using a task tracker from the App
            Store called 'Todoist'. Most of the time it functioned correctly,
            but I found the layout at times overwhelming. The worst part was
            that occasionally the habits I specified under a parent list would
            hop over to another list. I couldn't drag the items back to the
            correct parent list either; they just hopped back over. I couldn't
            find another app so I decided to make a simpler habit tracker, one
            with just the bare necessities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see below in the video the application is fairly simple;
            I only used UIKit and Foundation. In terms of view controllers the
            application mainly relies on UITableViewControllers. In the process
            of creating this application I made sure to separate the data models
            from the view controllers. For example, functions such as loading
            user data, detecting if the user is a first time user of the
            application and sorting the lists, were implemented in the data
            model. Sometimes, it was more appropriate to call a function outside
            of it's implementation file; in those cases I relied on delegates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before coding this application I had a very shallow idea of the
            model-view-controller design pattern. I understood it conceptually
            but I didn't know how it worked practically. I didn't know what
            optionals were, or what people in forums meant when they mentioned
            unwrapping one. It was also my first time interacting with the
            storyboard. I learned how to connect the views to code and how to
            add constraints so that the application would appear similarly on
            other devices. Of course there's still a lot I don't know, and
            Google has been my best friend in times of ignorance. Even though
            the application is fully functional there's plenty of features I've
            thought about adding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want the option of due dates for certain habits and local
            notifications to alert the user. I want to display streaks to track
            my consistency. I also want to make the app more fun, maybe by
            restructuring the app into a game. You can view my progress on
            GitHub using the icon in the footer.
