            With a constant stream of fresh builds new bugs are always
            introduced to the system. In the four months I worked at Transparent
            Language (TL) I learned and utilized a variety of methods related to
            bug detection and software quality assurance. For example, I learned
            that we can detect and/or prevent a majority of bugs by creating a
            thorough test plan. However, it's not enough that the test plan
            simply covers every feature of the software; different scenarios for
            each feature should be considered as well. Let's say you're testing
            the end user interface:
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking every button or link on the end user interface to check if
            every feature works may not be a thorough enough test. What if the
            feature is user specific? Then you would need to test that feature
            for all user types. However, more often than not, a test plan will
            not cover everything that needs to be tested; there may be too many
            scenarios to list! As such, besides using the test plans I
            created/were given, I've found it useful to test software with the
            developer console during my job at TL.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at TL, I've tested many features more than once; I've
            seen how tedious manual testing can be. I managed to find nearly 145
            bugs in approximately 4 months, but that was exhausting. That's
            pretty much what lead me to looking for an automation focused
            quality assurance job at Allscripts!

            Clinic Program at <b>Rapid7</b>
            <p style="font-size: 20px"><i>June 2019 - December 2019</i></p>
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a Computer Science major at Harvey Mudd the cherry on top for my
            degree was the Clinic Program. Think of it like a thesis
            replacement. We would work in groups for companies that paid some
            money to the college in return for our labor. For my Clinic Program
            I worked on the Rapid7 team in an Agile environment. Every week we
            would have a telephone meeting with our client. We would discuss our
            current progress, how much work we expected could be completed by
            next week, and any adjustments the client would like to make.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the NDA I signed I can only describe my work as follows: we
            integrated Rapid7's container assessment service with multiple
            continuous integration (CI) tools like/including Jenkins. In order
            to integrate their service, we created a plugin for each CI tool.
            The plugins would pass/fail a build based on various criteria.
            Finally, the plugins would generate a detailed report on a page
            created using vanilla HTML/CSS, reporting why the build
            passed/failed.
