            When I decided I wanted to be a front-end developer I realized there
            was one major programming language I didn't have under my belt:
            JavaScript. I didn't want to apply for a front-end developer job
            without being at least proficient in the language so I bought Jonas
            Schmedtmann's, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to
            Expert!" on Udemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is the same final project from that course. When I
            learn from a video I treat it like a homework assignment. If there's
            a problem to solve, I will pause the video, and create a solution by
            myself before continuing the video. As a result, I wrote a great
            majority of the code for this project alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you follow the link above you can see the final result of this
            project hosted on Netlify. It's a recipe finder that allows the user
            to search, add, and bookmark recipes through Jonas' API. Once a
            recipe is loaded onto the main view, the user can also change the
            number of servings as desired.

            During this project, I learned how to plan a project from the ground
            up by thinking about the product from a variety of perspectives:
            user stories, features, flowcharts, and the architecture of the
            project. I learned how to interact with APIs using the fetch
            function and how to await and store the data retrieved with async
            functions. I structured my code using the MVC
            (model-view-controller) paradigm so that the code would be more
            organized and manageable. Using the publisher-subscription model for
            handling events, and updating the DOM were also significant parts of
            this project.
