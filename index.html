											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>When I was a senior in high school I started to think about success. What does it mean to be succesful? How does someone succeed in something? How do I become successful at what I want to do? These are some of the questions that occupied my mind from time to time, and for a while I left them on the surface...</p>

								<p class="content">I currently work as a Software Quality Assurance Tester at Transparent Language. With a constant stream of fresh builds, new bugs are always introduced to the system. In the four months I've worked here I've learned and utilized a variety of methods related to bug detection and software quality assurance. For example, we can detect and/or prevent a majority of bugs simply by creating a thorough test plan. However, it's not enough that the test plan covers every feature of the software in question; different scenarios for each feature should be considered as well.
