                <!-- When I was a senior in high school I started to think about
                success. What does it mean to be succesful? How does someone
                succeed in something? How do I become successful at what I want
                to do? These are some of the questions that occupied my mind
                from time to time, and for a while I left them on the surface... -->
                Iâ€™ve thought a lot about what makes me happy. When I was younger
                I thought I could find happiness in the simple things like food.
                If I had a good meal I could be content for a while. When that
                feeling subsided I could bring it back with another meal, or
                maybe this time I could invoke the same feeling by playing a
                video game. Nowadays, I...

              <p>
                I was never completely satisfied with the habit apps I found on
                the App Store so I decided to try to build my own. It's pretty
                bare-bones, but I learned a lot from the experience.

                Set in Claremont, CA, this pixel-art minigame was the product of
                pure patience. The objective is simple: complete as many
                homework assignments as you can before the time runs out.

                During my software development course my peers and I created a
                new website for Claremont's local radio station, KSPC. This was
                my first experience with Ruby on Rails and the Agile
                environment.

            Transparent Language. With a constant stream of fresh builds, new
            bugs are always introduced to the system. In the four months I've
            worked here I've learned and utilized a variety of methods related
            to bug detection and software quality assurance. For example, we can
            detect and/or prevent a majority of bugs simply by creating a
            thorough test plan. However, it's not enough that the test plan
            covers every feature of the software in question; different
            scenarios for each feature should be considered as well. Let's say
            you're testing the end user interface for example... -->
            My most recent job was at Allscripts as an Associate Software
            Engineer. Shortly after, COVID-19 rendered Allscripts poor and as a
            side effect me jobless. While unemployed, I decided the quality
            assurance work at Allscripts wasn't what I wanted to do. I picked up
            JavaScript and React and am now looking for an entry level job as a
            front-end developer. 'Read More' if you're looking for an in depth
